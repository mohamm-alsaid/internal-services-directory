In addition, funding is provided to support treatment interventions for criminal risk factors such as antisocial thoughts and attitudes, antisocial peers, impulsivity and poor problem solving skills, anger management and so on. Effective interventions for adults should integrate addictions treatment with treatment for criminality.

Fifty-four beds serve high risk adults in a facility specialized in treating males involved with the criminal justice system. The remaining beds for men are located in three residential facilities within the community. Some of these beds are reserved for specific populations (e.g., justice involved adults convicted of sex crimes, East County property offenses). This program also provides 27 residential alcohol and drug treatment beds for high risk female adults in two facilities and four beds for dependent children. The current community treatment providers have been in existence for over 20 years and work collaboratively with the Department of Community Justice (DCJ) to treat adults with addictions and criminality.The program uses evidence-based practices to address addiction, mental health issues, parenting skills, healthy relationship dynamics, criminality, employment resources and relapse prevention counseling. Regular communication and coordination with a Parole-Probation Officer (PPO) is maintained to develop and implement treatment and supervision plans. With the expansion of Medicaid and private forms of insurance, some clinical services previously supported by the DCJ budget are now being reimbursed through health insurance.

		"Program Summary": "The Treatment First Program is a collaborative effort between DCJ, the courts, the DA's office, the public defender's office, local law enforcement, and community treatment providers. The program involves the use of a validated risk and needs assessment tool and serves a mixed population of low risk/need and moderate to high risk/need individuals. The program provides quadrant levels and separate group treatment services to ensure low risk individuals are not attending group sessions with moderate and high risk individuals and that their specific needs are met. Defendants with low risk and low needs will be assigned to a low supervision track. The Treatment First model reserves the STOP Court for the highest need, highest risk individuals while creating alternative tracks that match program design to individuals' needs and profiles. By creating multiple treatment tracks besides the STOP Court, the county is able to provide an appropriate system response to individuals who are non-addicted and/or low-risk. DCJ's contribution to the Treatment First program is the Assessment Team, which consists of  3 Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) who assess all incoming Treatment First drug cases using evidence-based risk assessment tools. These assessments are used to place incoming justice involved individuals (JIIs) in the level of supervision that research shows to be the most effective for their level of risk and specific A&D need. The assessment team assess JIIs both in and out of custody, and works closely with the Court, DA's Office and Defense Bar during the early Court process. Those placed in the STOP Court are supervised by a total of 3 PPOs. STOP serves adults charged with various drug-related offenses. Multnomah County's Drug Court is one of the oldest of its kind that collaborates with criminal justice partners to expedite the court process and offer drug treatment and is one component of the Treatment First Program. The treatment component is facilitated by a contracted agency who works closely with the court to provide mental health and drug treatment, employment resources, housing referrals, mentoring, residential treatment referrals and long-term follow-up services. The STOP Court is also staffed by PPOs who support the court by offering supervision, sanction and services.

They interview defendants who have a pending Multnomah County charge, which in turn provides a comprehensive, objective, and valid system for release decisions based on victim and community safety along with the defendants flight risk. Defendants charged with felonies and/or person-to-person misdemeanor crimes are subject to a full criminal history and warrant check in addition to the standard risk screening.The screening tool used to guide Recog staff has been validated by an independent research group and the results of that study have been approved by the Community Justice Advisory Council. In addition to evaluating the likelihood of appearing in court and risk for committing a new crime, Recog staff assist the court with release decisions for defendants that are ineligible for release by Recog staff. The unit serves as a 24-hour link between law enforcement agencies and Parole-Probation officers, by coordinating the process of holding parole and probation violators in jail and providing after-hours information on high risk individuals who are on electronic monitoring. The primary mission of the PSP unit is to evaluate the risk of releasing defendants prior to trial, to monitor defendants in the community and to ensure that defendants attend court hearings. PSP staff use evidence based criteria during their investigations to determine whether or not a defendant is likely to pose a safety risk or further is likely to attend subsequent court hearings. The results of these investigations are presented back to the Court when necessary.

A goal will be to continue to work with providers to increase housing options in East County, which would likely be more affordable as well as closer to where justice-involved individuals are living and receiving services.DCJ will continue to increase partnerships with other County departments, such as the Joint Office of Homeless Services and Mental Health and Addiction Services, and housing providers to identify housing in this area. The goal will be to identify more affordable housing than the current options of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) in downtown Portland. This past year additional beds were provided in East County by the opening of the Diane Wade House.

The Multnomah County Justice Reinvestment Program (MCJRP) includes funding for the jail to expedite assessments, for the court and the defense to assist with case coordination and scheduling, a deputy district attorney to facilitate case identification and case management, law enforcement to assist DCJ in monitoring individuals before and after sentencing, and additional staff at DCJ to carry out the program (assessment, report writing, and supervision). Also, 10% of the funding for Multnomah County must be appropriated to a non-profit working with crime victims. DCJ conducts an objective assessment of criminal risk and makes recommendations for how the individual could be managed in the community. This report is provided to the defense, prosecution, and court prior to sentencing and informs the sentencing process. For those individuals who are sentenced to probation rather than prison, DCJ provides intensive supervision, along with referrals to treatment. The case plan is individualized based on the person's specific criminal risk factors and community stability needs. This program offer also supports the ongoing Reentry Enhancement Coordination program. This is an evidence-based addictions treatment program for people leaving prison, and includes treatment, housing, mentoring, and employment assistance. In 2017, MCJRP secured a supplemental grant through CJC which addresses special populations (women and young justice involved individuals - JIIs) and second sentence programs. This additional funding provided a .5 victims advocate to the prosecution, a district attorney to review all probation violations to inform revocations, and two positions with the Defense to support JIIs accessing services and programs pre-adjudication. The MCJRP Law Enforcement (LE) Team comprised of two officers is also funded through this supplemental grant. To affect women, there are two Community Health Specialists who are trained in providing gender-informed services, trauma informed care and are skilled at helping the JJI navigate the health and mental health systems, as well as other resources in the community.

DCJ continues to use Effective Practices in Corrections Setting (EPICS), an evidence-based case management model. With EPICS, Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) follow a structured approach to their interactions with their clients, allowing PPOs to effectively target the criminogenic needs using cognitive behavioral interventions for high risk individuals. PPOs reinforce law-abiding behavior and link clients to treatment, employment and other services. Supervision is conducted through: a) home and office visits; b) contacts with family; c) correspondence with community members and treatment providers; and d) collaboration with law enforcement agencies. Adult supervision is an essential component of public safety. Nearly all prison inmates return to their county of sentencing upon release, where they must complete post-prison supervision.

Sexual and general recidivism rates of treated individuals convicted of sexual offenses has also been shown to be lower than recidivism rates of untreated individuals convicted of sex offenses (Looman et al 2000; Hanson et al 2002). The use of polygraph examinations is invaluable in the management and treatment of individuals convicted of sex offenses due to the information gained through the examination process.

This reduction will limit resources to meet the needs of the community. Specific impacts may include the following: 1)  Response times may be longer than desired due to limited number of officers available to respond, resulting in delayed response to public safety issues such as loose aggressive dogs, animals in distress, dog bite investigations, animals in traffic, cruelty investigations and welfare checks; 2) Officers' ability to respond to and assist law enforcement agencies in a timely manner may be reduced; 3) Officers' workloads may increase, especially during the peak season, resulting in greater use of overtime; and 4) The program will have greater difficulty meeting daily demands when officers are on vacation/sick, leaving the team even more shorthanded in the field.",

Increasing costs combined with flat revenues have shown that the current funding models are not sustainable. State and local land use goals promote density, which supports alternative modes of transit to the public (such as buses, bikes and rail) and have reduced the demand for gasoline consumption, consequently reducing fuel tax receipts.

The Transportation Capital program prioritizes and schedules projects to match available funds and new funds projected for a 5-year period. The countys transportation infrastructure assets are valued in excess of $1.8 billion, thus we deem it very important to protect these assets. Many factors contribute to the constant degradation of the transportation infrastructure which requires continual maintenance.

		"Program Summary": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, prohibits discrimination and promotes equal opportunity for people with disabilities in accessing employment, government services, public accommodations and public transportation.  Curb ramps are one of the most vital public service facilities on our roadways. Although everyone uses curb ramps to safely cross streets and access sidewalks, those with mobility impairments depend on them the most. Multnomah County has adopted ADA compliant design standards. This project ensures that the county meets the ADA standards by reconstructing non-compliant ramps. Over 90% of ramps in the countys right-of-way system require modification. Tier one includes 163 high priority ramps (of 950) that need to be upgraded. The inventory consists of a total of six tiers.In 2016, the county completed an inventory of physical mobility barriers within the countys right-of-way in compliance with Title II of the ADA, ODOT Policy PER 01-05, Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 447 and the Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guide (PROWAG) revision 2013. Each curb ramp location has been evaluated and priority has been given to ramps with the highest score based on factors that include location, usability and condition. Additionally, these factors considered equity by including demographics and access to services in prioritizing projects in communities that have been historically underserved. Multnomah County developed the scoring criteria to analyze the accessibility and usability of curb ramps on the countys road network for persons who use mobility devices such as wheelchairs and crutches.This project will start project development of the tier one priority ramps, moving them closer to construction.",

		"Program Summary": "Unincorporated Multnomah County is a unique and highly sought after location to live, work and recreate because it offers open spaces, natural and scenic resources, forests and farmland in close proximity to the state's largest city. Land Use Planning develops and implements codes and policies to preserve the rural character by preventing urban sprawl.The focus of the Long-Range Planning program is to create, revise and adopt plans, policies, and zoning codes in a uniform, fair and equitable manner to ensure that development is consistent with the rural character of the county. At the end of 2016, the county adopted the revised Comprehensive Plan and staff are currently consolidating the Zoning Code. Long-Range Planning staff will continue to focus on drafting code to implement the community's vision articulated within the revised plan. Planning staff also play a key role in coordinating with regional partners, such as Metro and the Columbia River Gorge Commission, to ensure the countys vision and values continue to be achieved. Further, planning staff help the county achieve goals for rural areas by addressing policies and plans within the Urban Growth Boundary.The Current Planning program provides assistance to property owners, neighbors, developers, realtors and other agencies with the land use process to objectively, consistently and fairly apply the countys development standards and procedures. Staff explain land use rules, review land use and building applications for compliance with applicable laws and problem solves complex land use issues with applicants and community members. The Code Compliance program responds to possible land use complaints on a voluntary compliance basis. The focus of this program is education and compliance to successfully resolve existing and potential issues. This is accomplished by encouraging property owners to voluntarily resolve land use conflicts without the use of penalties or fines whenever possible. Planning also manages a Solid Waste and Recycling Management program, which provides outreach materials and licenses service providers in the unincorporated areas of the county for solid waste and recyclable materials.

Utility expenses are a pass through charge to the building tenants that either occupy owned or leased space in facilities used for County operations.  Electric utilities constitute about half of the utility expenses followed by water/sewer, natural gas and waste/refuse. Facilities continues to work with the Office of Sustainability to educate building occupants on the value of resource conservation. The Energy-Utility Specialist in the Director's Office works with industry partners including the Energy Trust of Oregon, Oregon Department of Energy and the City of Portland to address operating efficiency and capture incentives for energy savings measures.  Utility rates fluctuate from year to year based on the availability of energy sources. These rates increase similar to the cost of inflation over time, but can vary based on economic factors. FPM implements energy and water efficiency projects in collaboration with building occupants to reduce consumption and achieve Climate Action Plan goals. In FY 2018, the Board of County Commissioners resolved to purchase 100% of electricity through renewable energy sources, consequently the FY 2020 utility rates continues to include the cost of purchasing renewable energy credits.",

In response, Multnomah County, the City of Portland, TriMet, Downtown Clean & Safe and Metro created the Healthy Streets pilot program to test the impact of SDBs on reducing syringe waste. The Healthy Streets pilot project is one component of a strategy to reduce the number of improperly discarded syringes and provide the public a safe community-based disposal option.Sharps disposal boxes create a 24/7 disposal option for safe disposal of syringes by community members finding used syringes. In partnership with other jurisdictions, the County has developed a website and communication materials to support the public in taking action when finding syringes. After reviewing existing designs for syringe drop boxes, the Healthy Streets pilot partners agreed to design and fabricate a unique, more tamper resistant syringe box. The procurement, design and fabrication of these boxes took longer than expect, and the boxes were installed in April 2019.

Network Access Control  can help us to understand what should and should not be on our network and restrict what these devices are able to access based on rules that we define.Privileged Access and Identity Management: Privileged access is the access most often targeted by cyber security threats because this access leads to the most valuable and confidential information.

		"Program Summary": "Primary among the duties of a deputy district attorney is to review cases submitted by local law enforcement agencies to determine whether the case should be charged as a crime.  This function is at the heart of the prosecution function.  The charging decision in every case is guided by a 22-step analysis contained within the MCDA Policy Manual.  As the case progresses through the system, the video may need to be re-reviewed, redacted, reformatted, and used in trial preparation and witness preparation.Police departments across the United States are phasing in the use of body warn cameras.  The Gresham Police Department has instituted an aggressive timeline for equipping their officers with body-worn cameras. Conservative estimates state that 1.5 hours of video will be created by a police officer on every shift.  Of this 1.5 hours, 10% will contain video pertinent to a criminal case  video that must be reviewed prior to charging and must be reproduced and given to the defense after charging.Body-worn camera evidence will be reviewed by a deputy district attorney.  Duplication and distribution of body-worn camera evidence will be accomplished by non-lawyer staff.  A review of comparably-sized offices from around the country has shown that, with the adoption of body-warn cameras by law enforcement, prosecutors personnel costs rose between 3%  10%.  For example, the Wayne County District Attorneys Office (Detroit, MI) experienced an 8% increase in personnel costs after several of their law enforcement partners began using body-worn cameras.Data from body-worn cameras will be voluminous and secure storage will be necessary to comply with witness/victim privacy concerns as well as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) compliance requirements.Body-worn camera footage will allow prosecutors to view crime scenes and witness/victim/suspect interviews through an unfiltered lens.  Transparency and system confidence will increase by virtue of additional objective evidence available for subsequent review.  Charging decisions will improve, leading to better, more just, outcomes.For additional MCDA Budget Information: http://mcda.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MCDA-Budget-Informational-Packet-FY-20.pdf",

This unit will produce research that explores and uncovers prosecutorial effects and trends in Multnomah Countys criminal justice system. This further insight will facilitate informed policy decision making to strategically address disparities within our county.Furthermore, the trend in public safety in the county and across the nation is for increased cooperation among peers to answer questions greater than any one entity.  Experience here in the county has shown that when one partner in criminal justice evaluation comes to the table without the capacity to keep up with others, that weak link causes the whole enterprise to suffer.  As public safety systems in Multnomah County join to tackle important questions, the District Attorneys office is determined to be an equal partner with others in this endeavor.  That commitment requires an expansion of the offices evaluation capacity to invest resources in maintaining and developing new partnerships and programs.Internally, the DAs office is asking more sophisticated questions about its own workings, including examinations of equity and disparity in prosecution, DDA workload and effectiveness, and case flow efficiency.  At one time it may have been sufficient to find answers to these questions through the authority of long tenure, management discussion and speculation by line staff.  These older methods are insufficient in the face of greater reliance in the county and nationwide on sophisticated data analyses that provide more objective means to drive policy.  The offices single temporary evaluator can no longer meet our needs; we must be about the business of building a more robust research and planning enterprise.http://mcda.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MCDA-Budget-Informational-Packet-FY-20.pdf",

This Unit prosecutes juveniles who have committed all but the most serious (Ballot Measure 11) crimes. This includes cases ranging from minor misdemeanors to serious felonies. The unit works closely with the Department of Community Justice (DCJ) Juvenile Division in developing appropriate sanctions aimed at accountability, community protection and reformation of the child or youth.  Additionally, one of the goals of this program is to reduce the number of youth who are exposed to the adult criminal system.For over 25 years this program has been involved in the Anne E. Casey Foundations Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI). The current interagency agreement with the Juvenile Services Division provides for opportunities for youth to have their matters handled informally, either through the CHI Early Intervention Program, or through informal handling by the Juvenile Department.  The current agreement calls for MCDA to provide legal sufficiency screening of all referrals, to insure that youth are held accountable only for acts that are legally sufficient.  Legal sufficiency screening by non-lawyers often results in youth being held accountable inappropriately.  The goal of these programs is to provide the principles of accountable and reformation without pulling a youth further into the Juvenile System.  These DDAs coordinate with the Department of Human Services, DCJ and juvenile court counselors to serve families impacted by the juvenile system.  Beginning July 1, 2019, the Department of Human Services will redirect state and federal funds from MCDA to pay their own lawyers at the Department of Justice to represent DHS in all TPR and dependency matters in Multnomah County. Refer to Program 15101B (Dependency and Delinquency) which partially restores this unit to two primary functions to serve families in Multnomah County. Lost funding, however, eliminates victims advocates to help those involved in the court process navigate the complicated and often unfamiliar juvenile system and impacts victim safety restitution or restorative justice when appropriate.

Misdemeanor Trial attorneys must also review, research and respond to all written motions as part of their trial preparation.Many misdemeanor cases resolve in one of the specialty courts that are staffed by the MTU.  Most non-violent offenders qualify for Community Court where they can earn a reduction or dismissal of their charges by giving back to local neighborhoods through community service while accessing social services such as alcohol treatment, drug treatment and mental health services.

Additionally reduction of false alarms conserves scarce public safety resources by reducing the time that law enforcement officers have to respond to reported false alarms.  The program includes penalties for the reporting of false alarms which motivates alarm customers to properly maintain their equipment and exercise sound alarm-use practices.  False alarm response is an inefficient use of time and resources and presents potential safety concerns for innocent citizens and law enforcement as a result of an armed response.

This will significantly increase inmate access to mental health clinicians, physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.

		"Program Summary": "Corrections Health currently operates clinics within MCDC and MCIJ. Currently, clinics are operated during the day shift, Monday through Friday. This schedule often does not allow for the ease of movement of inmates seeking medical or mental health appointments due to staffing short falls. Other aspects of jail operations which require the presence of an Escort Deputy such as court appearance movements, off-site for work crew projects, kitchen work crews, attorney visits, social services visits and other necessary tasks often limits staffing.  These multiple demands on Escorts at times limit the ability to move inmates for medical/mental health appointments due to the lack of Escort Deputy availability.MCSO has assessed, through collaboration with Corrections Health, the need for increased access to medical/mental health appointments. As such, the dedication of one additional Clinic Escort Deputy for expanded hours on swing shift at MCDC and MCIJ will allow medical/mental health appointments to be made much more frequently thus significantly increasing access for inmates to these critical services. A further expected positive outcome of this improvement is the shortening of jail stays, lessening of the use of force events, increased therapeutic assessments, fewer injuries to inmates and staff, potential release from custody, and an increased placement of inmates in the appropriate venues such as LEAD, Unity Center, Hospital, etc.  The upstaffing of the Clinic Escort Deputy position allows for the safe and secure management of the inmate population requiring Clinic services and creates a safe and secure working environment for Corrections Health Staff. The expansion of the presence of the Clinic Escort Deputy will significantly enhance an inmates ability to attend medical/mental health appointments and will increase access for clinicians to better serve the inmate population.",

Important factors when determining appropriate housing for an adult in custody include; criminal charge, institutional behavior, risk, and programmatic needs. The Units primary goal is to operate an objective classification system that provides for separations between violent and non-violent offenders and to facilitate movement through administrative processes from the most restrictive housing to the least restrictive housing in a safe and structured manner. This is a critical element to ensure that the jail meets a reasonable standard of care required by the United States Constitution. Best practice has shown that utilizing an objective classification process is key. This process creates a structure that allows in custody adults who require special housing or have special needs to be housed in an environment with those of like needs. Adults in custody who create the potential for compromising safety and security are housed in more restrictive environments with enhanced security as appropriate. The objective classification process is also designed to identify programmatic needs and provide adequate services and programs to assist in custody adults in building positive life-skills with the ultimate goal of successful re-entry into the community. Finally, the Classification Unit is also responsible to provide an in custody disciplinary process that is fair and balanced to maintain proper order in the corrections facilities, as well as to promote human values, individual dignity, and socially desirable changes in attitude and behavior.

Typically, a tourist hiker that has gone for a day hike at one of the many trailheads in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and, due to reduced daylight, has become disoriented which may result in injury or death. The MCSO \"Green Hornet Trail Rescue and wilderness Law Enforcement Team\" mission will be to decrease the Search and Rescue response times to missing and endangered persons calls at or near Columbia River Gorge trail locations.MCSO currently has members who are physically fit endurance athletes who are experienced with hiking, trail running, map reading, etc. By providing SAR training and necessary equipment, this program will significantly decrease SAR response call times and increase the opportunity to locate the lost and possibly injured persons much faster resulting in reduced overtime expense to MCSO (SAR related overtime averages approximately $100,000 per year). Twelve team members can provide preventative and proactive law enforcement/education functions during trailhead heavy use days, further reducing search incidents and impacting high incidents of property crime at these locations.In FY 2015, the Green Hornet Trail Rescue and Wilderness Law Enforcement Services Team utilized budgeted funds to train and equip members under newly established Oregon State Sheriff's Association search and rescue standards. This training added new capabilities which allow the team to be more effective in evening and night hours better meeting the needs of the hikers who find themselves lost and requiring rescue services. In the past, many searches had to wait for the next day break, this changes the outcome in favor of the lost hikers by the rescue team being less restricted by night conditions.  Additionally, this program will develop strategies to actively engage in proactive education and enforcement activities response to search, rescue and public safety issues developed from the Eagle Creek Fire.As hazardous conditions created by the fire continue to improve, it is anticipated that federal lands will incrementally re-open in FY19, providing for an increase in search and rescue incidents.",

Illegal dumping is a crime. Illegal dumping is a major problem that raises significant concerns with regard to safety, property values, and quality of life in the community. In addition, it is a major economic burden on local government, which is typically responsible for cleaning up dump sites. If not addressed, illegal dumps often attract more waste, potentially including hazardous wastes such as asbestos, household chemicals, paints, automotive fluids, and commercial or industrial wastes. Health risks associated with illegal dumping are significant. The regional housing crisis is resulting in more people living outside. The detectives coordinate with Metro staff, local police departments including MCSO Hope Team and social service providers to ensure impacts to Metros 17,000 acres of natural areas and parks are safely and humanely addressed. The need for this coordination increased significantly over the past two to three years which reduces the available time the detectives have to conduct investigations and surveillance.
